* paragraph-chain-indent

  This package provides a simple minor mode called
  =paragraph-chain-indent-mode=.  This mode adds overlays to your
  buffer according to certain rules so that short paragraphs that are
  separated by a blank line are displayed as extra indented.


** Customizations

   - =paragraph-chain-indent-indent-amount= : this controls the amount
     of indentation each chained paragraph should have.
   - =paragraph-chain-indent-independent-paragraph-size= : Any
     paragraph longer than this size won't be chained to the previous
     paragraphs.
